## 🔭 Project Details

ExoFinder **simulates the Transit Method** used in astrophysics to detect exoplanets using machine learning.  

**Key Features:**  
- 🌟 Adjust **stellar & planetary parameters**: radius, mass, orbital period, temperature  
- 📈 Visualize **real-time light curves** as planets transit stars (using **Chart.js**)  
- 🪐 Extract scientific features:  
  - Impact parameter  
  - Planet-to-star radius ratio  
  - Equilibrium temperature  
- 🎛️ Interactive control: planets appear on **hover**, noise toggle for telescope simulation  

**ML Integration:**  
- Datasets can be processed for classification with **Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost**, and ensemble models.  
- Designed for **education and research prototyping**.
